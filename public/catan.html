<!-- 
Todo list:----------
Trading
    ports
    other players
Use a knight before roll

Small --------
When spectator still in game but last player left
shouldnt be able to build road through settlement
knight move when 7 rolled
can't use dev card on turn you got it
move the chat down to most recent message

Not necessary for first time use ----------
Move dice into the svg
refactor longest road code into its own file
victory point change should be changed in catanjs
if player leaves then turn their houses and roads to unowned
Better way to indicate which player you are
When being robbered and it's your turn if you refresh then the boxes will be white instead of grey, should be grey until done with the robber event

10/11
It's disconnecting people randomly now OR refresh and it's a new user, not the same old user ?

Only show player boxes for that number of players
catan server now based on uuid not socket id
vertices and roads populated on refresh also number of cards and dev cards
created player object
turn logic
Some way to indicate whose turn it is

10/17
Fixed bug with robber event
Fixed bug with largest army
Year of plenty now increments while playing it
town doesn't flash if robber moved to rob second house and so on
first half longest road

10/18
Longest Road
    - max number of roads
    - victory points
    - ui
max number of towns
max number of cities
multiple click listeners for settlements and roads
on refresh cities become settlements
city edges dont flash when robbered
Can play dev cards when not your turn

10/19
shouldn't be able to buy city and press buy settlement at the same time
when build a city, the settlements turn invisible
Robber event doesn't currently stop others from playing on, also need to resume game correctly
Actions turn player's color rather than red when clicked
Get app on heroku
Game end when someone has 10 victory points
Cleaned up UI

10/20
Showing dev card numbers of player 0 not your player?
It should remember what room you were in last and connect you to that room
When someone leaves room, should update players
Should refresh screen if change new room
Need to update roomData when someone changes a room from chat server
    Also need to resend the ui to that room's ui
    Need to update playerData to remove the user or changed rooms
Sockets show up in list of rooms again
Handle user disconnect from room
make text not clickable

Refresh doesn't refresh grey if it's not your turn
When you build a road then whoseTurn boxes both turn not transparent
Hide begin game button on other players' screens and show spectate if not in game
When you place road in intro should end turn immediately
