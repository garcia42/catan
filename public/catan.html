vertices and roads populated on refresh also number of cards and dev cards
created player object

Some way to indicate whose turn it is
Created use Dev Card Ui

Robber Events
    On 7 roll

10/17
Fixed bug with robber event
Fixed bug with largest army
Year of plenty now increments while playing it
town doesn't flash if robber moved to rob second house and so on
first half longest road

10/18
Longest Road
    - max number of roads
    - victory points
    - ui
max number of towns
max number of cities
multiple click listeners for settlements and roads
on refresh cities become settlements
city edges dont flash when robbered
Can play dev cards when not your turn

10/19
shouldn't be able to buy city and press buy settlement at the same time
when build a city, the settlements turn invisible
Robber event doesn't currently stop others from playing on, also need to resume game correctly
Actions turn player's color rather than red when clicked
Get app on heroku
Game end when someone has 10 victory points
Cleaned up UI
