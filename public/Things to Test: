Things to Test:

Finished:

Vertices
1) Now uses instance variables
2) Added Ui elements to vertex object
3) Refactored code to make the town circles
4) Added Roads

Roads
1) Now use instance variables
2) Can get what color road is, and if visible
3) Began work on longest road
4) Added lines to roads
5) Refactored how roads are created to be more clear
6) Can now get road neighbors
7) Can get all roads of a certain color
8) Can get all neighbors of a road that are a certain color
9) Can find the end of the road chain of a certain color

ToDo:

Use new roads in vertices to find longest road
Turn lists of objects to dictionary of keys and objects
Instead of comparing roads using x and y, compare them using id
